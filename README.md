GSS Sandbox
========================

A simple app for experimenting with [Grid Style Sheets]


Getting Started
---------------

This project uses [Gulp]. In order to get started, you must first install
[nodejs] and [bower]. Then:

1. Install dependencies using `npm install && bower install`
2. Run `gulp watch` to begin working on the site. This will start an express and livereload server that serves your files, compiling HTML, CoffeeScript, LESS, GSS, and image files as you update them. (The default port is 8080)
